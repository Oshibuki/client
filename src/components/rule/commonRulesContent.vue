    <p><strong>ยง Conduct</strong></p>
    <ul style="text-align:justify">
        <li>Players should respect both the letter and the spirit of the rules.</li>
        <li>In order to maintain a healthy environment players must be respectful and polite towards one another and anyone
            else on the forum subboard, client website and the servers. If a player shows a poor attitude and displays
            rudeness or immaturity he/she will be punished by the administration. The range of punishments ranges from a
            warning to a permanent ban from WBMM, depending on the weight of the offence committed.</li>
        <li>Racism is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate ban with zero tolerance.</li>
        <li>Using default gear or any troll equipment that may hinder the progress of the team is forbidden.</li>
        <li>Impersonating individual players by using their names that cannot be differentiated from the real one.</li>

    <ul style="text-align:justify">
        <li>It is strictly prohibited to gain an advantage by modifying texture files or using game modifications such as
            aimbots or autoblock. Every player that is found to have modified texture files or using game modifications in
            order to gain an advantage will be banned from WBMM.</li>
        <li>In case you are unsure whether your game modification is allowed, ask the administration for clarification in
            your specific case.</li>
        <li>When requested by an admin players must take a screenshot of their game view while holding any kind of ranged
            weapon, or if they have no ranged weapon, their melee weapon, spear or lance. Players should ensure the
            screenshot contains the admin message, the scoreboard and buildings or players. Concerned players must send
            their screenshot to a WBMM admin immediately. Failing to comply with any part of this rule may result in a
            penalty for that player.</li>
        <li>When requested by a WBMM admin, players have to either record or stream their footage of all matches where they
            take part. Refusing or not fulfilling such a request will result in a permanent ban.</li>

            punishment.</li>
        <li>Dodging the queue when a match is found multiple times is forbidden.</li>
        <li>Dodging a match intentionally for any execuse is not permitted and will result in a ban.</li>
